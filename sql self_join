1.
How many stops are in the database.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM stops;

2.
Find the id value for the stop 'Craiglockhart'

SELECT id
FROM stops 
WHERE name = 'Craiglockhart';

3.
Give the id and the name for the stops on the '4' 'LRT' service.

SELECT id, name FROM stops, route
  WHERE id=stop
    AND company='LRT'
    AND num='4';

4.
The query shown gives the number of routes that visit either London Road (149) or Craiglockhart (53). Run the query and notice the two services that link these stops have a count of 2. Add a HAVING clause to restrict the output to these two routes.

SELECT company, num, COUNT(*)
FROM route WHERE stop=149 OR stop=53
GROUP BY company, num
HAVING COUNT(*)=2;

5.
Execute the self join shown and observe that b.stop gives all the places you can get to from Craiglockhart, without changing routes. Change the query so that it shows the services from Craiglockhart to London Road.

SELECT a.company, a.num, a.stop, b.stop
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
WHERE a.stop = 53 AND b.stop=149

6.
The query shown is similar to the previous one, however by joining two copies of the stops table we can refer to stops by name rather than by number. Change the query so that the services between 'Craiglockhart' and 'London Road' are shown. If you are tired of these places try 'Fairmilehead' against 'Tollcross'

SELECT a.company, a.num, stopa.name, stopb.name
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop=stopa.id)
  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop=stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name='Craiglockhart'
AND stopb.name='London Road'

7.
Give a list of all the services which connect stops 115 and 137 ('Haymarket' and 'Leith')

SELECT DISTINCT a.company, a.num
  FROM route a, route b
  WHERE a.num=b.num AND a.company=b.company
    AND a.stop=115 AND b.stop=137

8.
Give a list of the services which connect the stops 'Craiglockhart' and 'Tollcross'

SELECT a.company, a.num
  FROM route a, route b, stops S1, stops S2
  WHERE a.num=b.num AND a.company=b.company
    AND a.stop=S1.id AND b.stop=S2.id
    AND S1.name='Craiglockhart'
    AND S2.name='Tollcross'

9.
Give a distinct list of the stops which may be reached from 'Craiglockhart' by taking one bus, including 'Craiglockhart' itself, offered by the LRT company. Include the company and bus no. of the relevant services.

SELECT DISTINCT S2.name, b.company, b.num
FROM stops S1, stops S2, route a, route b
WHERE S1.name='Craiglockhart'
  AND S1.id=a.stop
  AND a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num
  AND b.stop=S2.id

10.
Find the routes involving two buses that can go from Craiglockhart to Lochend.
Show the bus no. and company for the first bus, the name of the stop for the transfer,
and the bus no. and company for the second bus.

SELECT 
  firstbus.busnumber AS 'num', 
  firstbus.company, 
  secondbus.transfer AS 'name', 
  secondbus.busnumber AS 'num', 
  secondbus.company 
FROM (
  SELECT r1.num AS 'busnumber', 
  r1.company AS 'company', 
  r2.stop AS 'stopp' 
  FROM route r1 
  JOIN route r2 ON (r1.num = r2.num AND r1.company = r2.company) 
  JOIN stops s1 ON s1.id = r1.stop
  JOIN stops s2 ON s2.id = r2.stop
  WHERE s1.name = 'Craiglockhart'
  ) firstbus
  JOIN
  (
  SELECT s1.name AS 'transfer', 
  r1.num AS 'busnumber', 
  r1.company AS 'company', 
  r1.stop AS 'stopp', 
  r1.pos AS 'pos' 
  FROM route r1 JOIN route r2 ON (r1.num = r2.num AND r1.company = r2.company) 
  JOIN stops s1 ON s1.id = r1.stop
  JOIN stops s2 ON s2.id = r2.stop
  WHERE s2.name = 'Lochend'
  ) secondbus
  ON firstbus.stopp = secondbus.stopp
ORDER BY firstbus.busnumber, name, 4;
